									<p>My research focuses on understanding how volcanism modifies the surfaces of silicate bodies such as Venus, Earth, and Mars. I study the physical process associated with volcanic activity processes using a combination of physical volcanology, radar remote sensing and a tiny bit terrestrial field work. Listed below are projects that I have worked on. </p>

									<h3>Radar mapping of Arsia Mons caldera on Mars</h3>

												<p>The caldera of Arisa Mons, the southernmost and the most evolved of the Thatrsis Montes on Mars, has several small shields, fissures and lava flows on its floor. These features were found to be ~150 Myr old, indicating some of the most recent volcanic activity on Mars. SHAllow RADar data over this area showed several time-delay reflectors indicating different density lithologies in the shallow subsurface (up to 120 km depths). We mapped individual reflectors at different delay times and used Bayesian inversion techniques to determine dielectric propoerties of the subsurface lithologies from the mapped reflectors. Most of the reflectors were consistent with dense, lossy lava flows. However, a specific group of reflectors in the southern region of the caldera was overlain by low density material such as unconsolidated sediments or pyroclastic material up to 60 m thick. The inferred radar properties provide evidence for atleast one previous episode of explosive activity in the caldera; it is likely that the caldera experienced many transitions between effusive and explosive activity in the past. </p>

									<h3>Pyroclastic Density Currents on Venus</h3>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Pyroclastic activity on Venus is throught to be limited because of 1) the high atmospheric T/P which reduces magmatic volatile exsolution and 2) high atmospheric density which makes it hard to sustain buoyant ash plumes. It has been hypothesized that volatile contents exceeding 2-5% could could cause explosive disruption of magma at the resurface. Resulting eruption columns are likelier to collapse (due to the hot and dense ambient atmosphere) feeding pyrcolastic density currents (PDCs). Several deposits with high radar returns near volcanic summits on Venus have been proposed to be formed from PDCs. These deposits have very long runouts and large spatial extents, typical of ancient PDCs on Earth not observed in current times. I model PDCs under Venus conditiosns to investigate their exceptional mobility, interaction with topography and what they tell us about volcanic extrusion rates and eruption conditions in the past. </p>

									<h3>SAR backscatter modeling of planetary surfaces</h3>
												<p>Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of planetary surfaces contain information about the upper 10s of centimeters of the subsurface (subject, of course, to the radar wavelength). The measured power and polarization state of the return signal from a planetary surface is sensitive to the observing geomtry, surface reflectivity and roughness, thickness of the layers within the signal penetration depth, and loss of signal within a layer. Understanding how a radar wave responds to variations in these paramaters is important to interpreting the radar echoes received from planetary surfaces. I use a radiative transfer approach to determine the different scattering mechanisms that a radar wave is subjected to when it interacts with the geologic target. This allows us to simulate the the power and polarimetry properties of returns from different synthetic subsurface models, which can then be compared with existing observations from different planetary radar missions. I'm currently using this technique to study the anomalous radar properties of some of the Venusian PDC deposits. </p>

									<h3>Geologic investigations of two possible Artemis landing sites</h3>
												<p>This project was done as a part of LPI's summer internship program in collaboration with Jordan Bretzfelder, Antonio Lang, Nandita Kumari, and David Kring. We looked at two possible landing sites neat the lunar south pole to assess the geological and ISRU potential, and EVA opprtunities at these two locations. </p>
